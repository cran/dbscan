Description: A fast reimplementation of the density-based DBSCAN clustering algorithm for spatial data introduced by Ester et al. 'A Density-Based Algorithm for Discovering Clusters in Large Spatial Databases with Noise,' 1996. This implementation uses the kd-tree data structure (from library ANN) for faster k-nearest neighbor search. The implementation is many times faster than the R-based implementation in package fpc.
