Description: A fast reimplementation of several density-based algorithms of
    the DBSCAN family for spatial data. Includes the DBSCAN (density-based spatial
    clustering of applications with noise) and OPTICS (ordering points to identify
    the clustering structure) clustering algorithms HDBSCAN (hierarchical DBSCAN) and the LOF (local outlier
    factor) algorithm. The implementations use the kd-tree data structure (from
    library ANN) for faster k-nearest neighbor search. An R interface to fast kNN
    and fixed-radius NN search is also provided.
