Version 0.9-6 (2015-12-14)
  * OPTICS: fixed second bug reported by Di Pang
  * all methods now also accept dist objects and have a search method "dist"
    which precomputes distances.

Version 0.9-5 (2015-10-04)
  * OPTICS: fixed bug with first observation reported by Di Pang
  * OPTICS: clusterings can now be extracted using optics_cut

Version 0.9-4 (2015-09-17)
  * added tests (testthat).
  * input data is now checked if it can safely be coerced into a
    numeric matrix (storage.mode double).
  * fixed self matches in kNN and frNN (now returns the first NN correctly).

Version 0.9-3 (2015-9-2)
  * Added weights to DBSCAN.

Version 0.9-2 (2015-08-11)
  * Added kNN interface.
  * Added frNN (fixed radius NN) interface.
  * Added LOF.
  * Added OPTICS.
  * All algorithms check now for interupt (CTRL-C/Esc).
  * DBSCAN now returns a list instead of a numeric vector.

Version 0.9-1 (2015-07-21)
  * DBSCAN: Improved speed by avoiding repeated sorting of point ids.
  * Added linear NN search option.
  * Added fast calculation for kNN distance.
  * fpc and microbenchmark are now used conditionally in the examples.

Initial Release version 0.9-0 (2015-07-15)
